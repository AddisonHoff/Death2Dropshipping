# Death2Dropshipping

I created a python terminal program that takes the name from an eCommerce store and uses the Aliexpress API and prints off similar Aliexpress items the link to the Aliexpress results, so you can save money by purchasing it directly from the manufacturer. 

TO RUN:

Sign up for both these APIS and replace the MLScrape Keys and Aliexpress keys and hots, marked by comments.

Run aliexpressSearch.py like any other python file.
